            Brihadeeswara Temple, a masterpiece of Dravidian architecture, is one of India's most prized architectural treasures. Built in the early 11th century, it celebrates the power and artistic vision of the Chola Empire.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            The temple is renowned for its grand scale, architectural excellence, and the intricate sculptures that adorn its walls. The vimana (tower) rises to a height of 216 feet (66 meters), making it one of the tallest of its kind in the world.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700">
            What makes this temple even more remarkable is that it was built using interlocking techniques without the use of mortar, showcasing the advanced engineering knowledge of the Chola period. The entire structure is made of granite, with some stones weighing up to 80 tons having been transported from quarries over 60 kilometers away.
