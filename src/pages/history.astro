              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Raja Raja I (born Arulmozhi Varman) was one of the most powerful kings of the Chola dynasty. During his reign, the Chola Empire expanded tremendously, encompassing most of South India and parts of Sri Lanka and the Maldives.

              <p class="text-gray-700">
                Beyond being a skilled military commander, Raja Raja I was a patron of arts, architecture, and literature. The Brihadeeswara Temple stands as his greatest architectural legacy, showcasing not only his devotion to Lord Shiva but also his vision to create a monument that would symbolize the might and cultural sophistication of the Chola Empire.

              <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                The construction of Brihadeeswara Temple began around 1003 CE and was completed by 1010 CE, taking approximately seven years. This was remarkably efficient for a structure of its size and complexity, especially considering the technological limitations of the era.
              </p>
              <p class="text-gray-700">
                According to inscriptions, the temple was consecrated in the 25th regnal year of Raja Raja Chola I with an elaborate ceremony. The temple was originally called "Rajarajeswaram" after its founder, though it later became known as Brihadeeswara Temple (the temple of the Great Lord Shiva).
